Comparison of class-based (Java) and prototype-based (JavaScript) object systems
Class-based (Java)--||--Prototype-based (JavaScript)
Class and instance are distinct entities.--||--All objects can inherit from another object.
Define a class with a class definition; instantiate a class with constructor methods.--||--Define and create a set of objects with constructor functions.
Create a single object with the new operator.--||--Same.
Construct an object hierarchy by using class definitions to define subclasses of existing classes.--||--Construct an object hierarchy by assigning an object as the prototype associated with a constructor function.
Inherit properties by following the class chain.--||--Inherit properties by following the prototype chain.
Class definition specifies all properties of all instances of a class. Cannot add properties dynamically at run time.--||--Constructor function or prototype specifies an initial set of properties. Can add or remove properties dynamically to individual objects or to the entire set of objects.
